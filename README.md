This EDA project was made within the framework of Data Analyst course by TovTech.
As part of the project, I chose topic of Video Games reviews, because it is one of my favorite topics.
During the project, I was found amazing things in following dataset.

***By framework of EDA project, I was researched the next questions:***

* How do user ratings correlate with factors like popularity or completion time?
* Are there any significant differences in user ratings for games released on different genres per year?
* How does the sentiment of user reviews during reviews of the games?

This EDA project provided valuable insights into the trends and user preferences within the gaming industry based on the "Popular Video Games 1980 - 2023 ðŸŽ®"  dataset. We observed that adventure games hold the largest share, indicating a strong preference for exploratory and story-driven experiences among gamers. RPGs are also very popular, suggesting that players enjoy immersive, character-driven narratives and complex game mechanics. The analysis of correlations between various metrics like ratings, reviews, wishlists, and backlogs revealed interesting connections. It is noteworthy that popularity metrics are highly interconnected, and a game gaining traction in one area is likely to perform well in the others. The sentiment analysis indicated that the majority of game reviews are positive, suggesting that the games are generally well-received by the audience.

Overall, this EDA project has shed light on user preferences and trends in the gaming industry. These insights can be valuable for game developers, publishers, and marketers in creating, promoting, and distributing games that cater to the evolving needs and interests of gamers.

## How the learning in Datacamp helped me with the project?

Before beginning this project, I was learned Python and Pandas courses in DataCamp.
They gave explation, interactvie practices and introduced projects.
Courses of DataCamp helped me more understand how work statistics, data.
Last course that I learned in DataCamp before I began project is "Exploratory Data Analysis in Python".
This course helped understand more how works EDA and how to make EDA project.
